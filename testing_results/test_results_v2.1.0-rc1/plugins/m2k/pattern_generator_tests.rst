        7. Open channel ‘CH 0’. On its channel manager, change trace height to 50.
                - **Expected Result:** The trace height should now be twice as shown in steps resources picture, compared to previous.
                - **Actual Result:**

        8. Change height again to 10.
                - **Expected Result:** The height should now be lower as shown in steps resources picture

        9. Knobs
        10. Checking frequency knob. Set the knob to large increment. No orange dot on the center. 
        11. Change frequency value using the ± button.
                - **Expected Result:** The frequency value should change accordingly with a high increment/decrement from 5 KHz to 10 KHz.

        12. Set the knob to ±1 unit interval. With orange dot on the center. 
        13. Change frequency value using the ± button.
                - **Expected Result:** The frequency value should change accordingly with ±1 unit interval.

        14. Checking the output: PP mode
        15. Connect the DIO0 to oscilloscope ch1+, and oscilloscope ch1- to gnd. This is to monitor the output from the pattern generator.
        16. Enable DIO0 in pattern generator. 
        17. Set pattern to clock with 5 kHz frequency. 
        18. Set output as PP. 
        19. Run instrument and monitor on Oscilloscope.
                - **Expected Result:** The oscilloscope should show clock pulses from logic 0 to 1. It should look like in steps resources picture.
                - **Actual Result:**

        20. Try other patterns such as random pattern and monitor on oscilloscope.
                - **Expected Result:** The oscilloscope should show random pulses from logic 0 to 1. It should look like in steps resources picture.
                - **Actual Result:**

        21. Repeat steps 15. and 20. for all channels
        
        22. OD mode
       
        23. Change output to OD. Monitor output in oscilloscope.
                - **Expected Result:** Oscilloscope should only show logic 0 since output is now in OD mode.
                - **Actual Result:**

        24. Do 23. to other channels.
        25. To output two logic levels when operating in OD, a pull up resistor is needed. Connect the breadboard connection shown in steps resources.
        26. Set power supply to 5V. Run power supply, pattern generator and monitor in oscilloscope.
                - **Expected Result:** The trace should show two logic levels, with a few mV offset. When power supply is turned off, the oscilloscope should show only logic 0.

        28. Print
        
        29. Click on Print button and save file as sample.pdf
                - **Expected Result:** Upon saving, the prompt window should look like the steps resources picture.
