                - **Actual Result:** Works as expected.

        9. Set the knob to ±1 unit interval. With orange dot on the center. Change frequency value using the ± button.
                - **Expected Result:** The frequency value should change accordingly with ±1 unit interval.
                - **Actual Result:** Works as expected.

        10. Checking the output: PP mode
        11. Connect the DIO0 to oscilloscope ch1+, and oscilloscope ch1- to gnd. This is to monitor the output from the pattern generator.
        12. Enable DIO0 in pattern generator. Set pattern to clock with 5 kHz frequency. Set output as PP. Run instrument and monitor on Oscilloscope.
                - **Expected Result:** The oscilloscope should show clock pulses from logic 0 to 1. It should look like in steps resources picture.
                - **Actual Result:** The values are displayed correctly.

        13. Try other patterns such as random pattern and monitor on oscilloscope.
                - **Expected Result:** The oscilloscope should show random pulses from logic 0 to 1. It should look like in steps resources picture.
                - **Actual Result:** Works as expected.

        14. Repeat steps 10. and 13. for all channels
        15. OD mode
        16. Change output to OD. Monitor output in oscilloscope.
                - **Expected Result:** Oscilloscope should only show logic 0 since output is now in OD mode.
                - **Actual Result:** Works as expected.

        17. Do 5.1 to other channels.
        18. To output two logic levels when operating in OD, a pull up resistor is needed. Connect the breadboard connection shown in steps resources.
        19. Set power supply to 5V. Run power supply, pattern generator and monitor in oscilloscope.
                - **Expected Result:** The trace should show two logic levels, with a few mV offset. When power supply is turned off, the oscilloscope should show only logic 0.
                - **Actual Result:** The values are displayed correctly.

        20. Repeat step 5.3 and 5.4 for all channels.
        21. Print
        22. Click on Print button and save file as sample.pdf
                - **Expected Result:** Upon saving, the prompt window should look like the steps resources picture.
                - **Actual Result:** The values are displayed correctly.

        24. See more info
        25. Click the 'See more info' icon on the upper left of the pattern generator window.
                - **Expected Result:** It should lead to the wiki page of pattern generator.
                - **Actual Result:** The values are displayed correctly.
