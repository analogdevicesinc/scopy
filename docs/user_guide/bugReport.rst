Bug
---

A `Software_bug <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug>`__ is a flaw, error
in a software application that causes it to **behave unexpected**, **hang** or
even **crash**. No matter how sharp our skills are, or rigorous our testing, a
few bugs are bound to slip through the cracks every now and then. As much as you
don't want them; we don't want/like them either. However, some bugs can be
difficult to replicate, track down and eventually fix without a well written bug
report. If you encounter one of the what you believe is a software bug, this
guide is here to provide a step by step approach into reporting the bug on our
`issue tracker <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/scopy/issues>`__ .

What we need is:
   -  Brief description of the bug
   -  Steps to reproduce the bug
   -  Expected result
   -  Actual result with a screenshot or screen capture

Before reporting a bug
----------------------

Is it a bug? or is it a feature request? Something not working properly (a bug)
is different than something working differently than you want. `Feature
requests <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/scopy/issues>`__ are tracked in
the same place as bugs, but will not have a ''bug'' label.

Some :ref:`troubleshooting steps <troubleshooting>`
that might be worth looking at to understand if you have a potential common
hardware problem.

Scopy is continuously being improved from one version to another, (with bug
fixes) and with new features. Ensure you are using the `latest release
version <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/scopy/releases/latest>`__ of scopy.
Try to replicate the bug on latest release and if the bug persists first
check to see if someone else has reported the same
`bug. <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/scopy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug>`__

If the bug has not yet been reported follow the steps bellow.

Description of the Bug
----------------------

The easiest/most straightforward way to describe the bug, is to let us see how
scopy was configured when the bug occurred. From ne session to another, Scopy
uses **.ini** files to load its previous state when it was closed. These file
are located in:

-  **Windows:** C:\\Users\\<your_username>\\AppData\\Local\\ADI\\Scopy-v2 Sometimes this is a
   hidden directory, and you `unhide
   it. <https://cybertext.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/cant-see-the-appdata-folder/>`__
-  **Linux:** /home/<your_username>/.config/ADI/Scopy-v2/
-  **Mac:** /Users/<your_username>/.config/analog.com

The **\*.ini** files are simple text files:
   -  **Scopy.ini** : captures the state of all the instruments, and menu
      settings, and locations of all windows.
   -  **Preferences.ini** : controls the preferences of scopy
   -  **Plugin.ini** : each plugin has his own .ini file 

When a bug/crash occurs, this files can be trivial in inspecting the
configuration that caused Scopy to fail, and can be critical in allowing
a developer to easily replicate the problem.

Scopy provides some crash dump logs with timestamp in case the application 
crashes. These are located in the same folder as **.ini** files at the 
paths mentioned above with the name "ScopyCrashDump-yymmdd-hhmmss.id".
This files will never be deleted by Scopy, they can be manually deleted 
by the user.

In order to generate a logging file that provides the most information, after
encountering a bug, restart Scopy and reproduce the exact steps that lead to 
the bug.

.. warning::

   Making a backup of the entire folder where the **.ini** files are located and
   adding it to the bug report is critical for developers.

Older Versions of Scopy (v 1.2.0 and older) do not capture:

-  **Operating System:** Scopy runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS. This is
   important for us as the dependencies we use for Scopy might have different
   implementations on different operating systems and we could track the bug to
   one of them if we knew the system.
-  **Scopy Version:** Scopy is continuously being improved from one version to
   another, with bug fixes and with new features. Sometimes this new features
   also bring hidden bugs, but sometimes they also fix older bugs. So making
   sure that we now exactly the version of Scopy that crashed greatly improves
   our debugging.
-  **Firmware Version:** The firmware version is also important, as the bug
   might be tracked down into the firmware that is currently installed on the
   device itself.

Steps to reproduce the Bug
--------------------------

Some bugs might be obvious to reproduce (always clicking a button crashes
Scopy), but some are hard and only happen in a specific configuration.
Mentioning the exact steps that lead to the bug are trivial for us in order to
properly reproduce it.

Example Report
--------------

**Operating System:** Linux

**Scopy Version:** v1.2.0 or git tag

**Firmware Version:** 0.25

**Steps to reproduce the bug**:

-  Started the Signal Generator with the following configuration: 5khz 2V sine
   wave on channel 1 ...
-  Started the Oscilloscope
-  On the Oscilloscope, selected the measurements menu
-  When enabling statistics in the measurements menu, Scopy crashes.

Attached the ".ini" files also containing the "crashdump" folder (if on Windows)
and the logging files if present
