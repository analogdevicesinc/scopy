  Scopy Preferences can be accessed using the bottom left side **preferences
  button**. On the right side of the page, preferences for each plugin
  are available. More details can be found in their specific plugin
  documentation section.

  The **Open** button will try to open the specific OS explorer in 
  order to find the preference storage file.

  Clicking the **Reset Scopy** button will reset the application to a default
  configuration.

  Changing some of the listed preferences will require an application
  restart. More details on each preference are listed below.
