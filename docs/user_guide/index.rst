Application Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Homepage layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analogdevicesinc/scopy/doc_resources/resources/scopy-start-page.png
    :align: center
..

The Home view is divided into multiple sections:

Device browser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Contains a list of devices (USB/serial/network/emulated) that Scopy can connect to.

 USB devices are scanned automatically at startup when the top right "Scan"
 switch is ON.

Add(+) device page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Can be used to connect to devices that are not automatically detected in
 the above mentioned list.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analogdevicesinc/scopy/doc_resources/resources/scopy-add-page-iio.png
    :align: center
..

 The interface has two tabs for device configuration:

  - **IIO**: adding and configuring IIO devices.
  - **EMU**: adding and configuring virtually emulated devices using
    the iio-emulator.

 The **IIO** tab includes settings for scanning, connecting, and configuring
 various connected devices.

 **SCAN Section**

 - **Filter**: Allows the user to choose which connection types to scan for.

   If none is selected, the application will scan for all types.

   A new scan is triggered every time one of the following
   options is selected.

    - **Local**: Scans local devices, usually on target.
    - **IP**: Scans network devices.
    - **USB**: Scans USB devices.
 - **Context**: List of currently scanned contexts.
 - **Refresh**: Button to re-scan and detect available devices.

 **SERIAL Section**

 - **Port Name**: Drop-down to select available serial devices.
 - **Baud Rate**: Allows setting the communication speed.
 - **Port Config**: Specifies the data format and parity.
 - **Refresh**: Refreshes the list of available serial devices.

 **URI**

 - **URI Input**: This is where the user specifies the connection URI.
   This field is automatically populated based on the selection from one
   of the previous sections but the user can manually input the URI of
   the required device.
 - **Verify**: Button to verify the connection based on the provided URI.
   This will display an error if no such context is available. On success
   a different page will be displayed allowing the user to configure
   compatible plugins.


 The **EMU** tab includes settings for selecting the emulation mode,
 XML configuration files, RX/TX devices, and URI for the emulated device.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analogdevicesinc/scopy/doc_resources/resources/scopy-add-page-emu.png
    :align: center
..

 **DEMO OPTION**:
   - Drop-down menu to select one of the predefined emulated devices.
   - Options are: adalm2000, pluto, swiot, pqm and generic.
     When using the **generic** option, the user must provide a path
     of the XML for the emulated device. If an existing option is
     selected, the XML path will be automatically completed in the
     field.

 **XML PATH**:
   - Specifies the path to the XML configuration file required for the emulation.

 **RX/TX DEVICES**:
   - Specifies the RX (receive) and TX (transmit) device files for the emulation mode.
     These are .bin files containing samples to be used on RX/TX devices.
   - For detailed examples check the `official iio-emu Github docs
     <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/iio-emu/blob/main/GENERIC_EMULATOR.md>`_ .


 **URI**:
   - The URI is automatically set to **ip:127.0.0.1** or **ip:localhost**.

 **Enable Demo Button**:
   - Validates and activates the demo mode based on the selected configuration.
   - Automatically displays the IIO tab and populates the URI field
     if the EMU validation is successful.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analogdevicesinc/scopy/doc_resources/resources/scopy-add-page-plugin-config.png
    :align: center
..

 The add device plugin configuration page will allow the user to
 select compatible plugins for the newly added device.

 By default, the plugins with the highest priority will be selected.
 Clicking the **ADD DEVICE** button will finalize the process and
 create a new device entry in the device browser.

.. tip::

  Scopy can be connected to multiple IIO devices simultaneously starting
  with v2.0. All the connected or available IIO devices will be available
  in the device browser.

Instruments Menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 This left side area can contain multiple sections of instrument lists,
 one for each connected or selected device. It can also be empty if
 no device is connected or selected. If the device is selected but not
 connected, the instruments will be available only as previews, without
 responding to any interaction.

 A device section has a collapsible section displaying the name and URI of
 the device and will contain a list of available instruments for the selected
 device. The instruments for an IIO device are provided by one or multiple
 plugins based on compatibility. (Example: An IIO device containing only
 ADCs will not have the DAC plugin as an available instrument).
 For more details on the Scopy plugin system and existing plugins please
 check below the "Plugins" documentation section.

Information Window
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 This area contains the welcome page, add device page and for each device
 a device page.

 The device page will contain context attributes extracted from the
 IIO context, as well as specific buttons or controls that can be provided
 by any compatible plugin (Example: The ADALM2000 has a "Calibrate" button
 which is only specific to this type of device).

Save & Load session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Scopy can save or load different configurations in an .ini file format.

Preferences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analogdevicesinc/scopy/doc_resources/resources/scopy-general-prefs.png

User Guides
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Scopy can now interact with multiple hardware devices at a time. Once a device is
selected to be used with the application, a list of instruments that are
available for that device will be visible as a preview. Once connected to a device
the instruments will be enabled and available.

Each instrument can be opened from the left menu. The icon on the right of
the instrument name specifies that the instrument is enabled and provides
a shortcut that allows an instrument to be turned on or off.

For each connected device, there is an entry in the left side menu, above
all the instruments, displaying the **Name** and **URI** of the
connected device.

The instruments menu can be minimized by clicking on the **Scopy** button near
the top-left window.


Detaching Instruments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scopy provides the detaching into multiple windows feature for each instrument
available, providing a better view/manipulation.

This can be done by double clicking the instrument to detach it.

Please make sure that the **Double click to detach** a tool
option is enabled in the **Preferences** menu.
