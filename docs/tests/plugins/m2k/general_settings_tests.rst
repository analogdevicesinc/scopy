**Preconditions:**
        - Scopy is installed on the system.
        - OS: ANY
        - Use :ref:`M2k.Usb <m2k-usb-pattern-generator>` setup.

**Steps:**
        1. Save the current profile. On the bottom part of the left panel, click the “Save” icon and save the profile as “default.ini.” Change any setting on any instrument and reload the profile.
                - **Expected Result:** The change made on a certain instrument should be undone and the default profile should load.
        2. Oscilloscope’s Settings: For Channel 1: Time Base: 100ns, Volts/Div: 2V, For Channel 2: Volts/Div: 5V. Signal Generator’s Settings: For Channel 1: Sinewave, 3Vpp, 3MHz, For Channel 2: Square Wave, 5Vpp, 900kHz. Spectrum Analyzer’s Settings: Frequency Sweep Setting: Start – 500kHz; Stop – 5MHz, Amplitude: Top – 10dBFS; Bottom – -140dBFS.
        3. Connect AWG channel 1 to Scope Ch1+ and AWG channel 2 to Scope Ch2+. Connect Scope Ch1- and Ch2- to GND.
        4. Run the Signal Generator instrument, and check the output on Oscilloscope and Spectrum Analyzer. Then save the profile as “profile1.ini.”
                - **Expected Result:** The output waveform on the Oscilloscope should be set in a way that the signals are can properly be seen compared with the default settings. In the Spectrum Analyzer the fundamental frequency of both signals should be present in the plot window set by the sweep setting.
        5. Reload the default setting by deleting the file in ``C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Roaming\ADI``. Reload “profile1.ini” and run the signal generator and oscilloscope or Spectrum Analyzer.
                - **Expected Result:** The result should be the same on the saved profile.
        6. Pattern Generator’s Settings: Enable DIO2, DIO3, DIO6, DIO7, DIO10, DIO11, DIO14 and DIO15. Group DIO1 and DIO2 set to random and 1MHz frequency. Group DIO10 and DIO11 and set to Binary Counter at 1MHz. Set the other enabled DIOs to clock at 1MHz. Logic Analyzer’s Settings: Group DIO0, DIO1, DIO4, DIO5, DIO8, DIO9, DIO12, and DIO13 and set to parallel mode. Group DIO2 and DIO3 and set to parallel mode. Group DIO10 and DIO11 and set to parallel mode. Set the time base to 1us. Digital IO’s Settings: Set DIO0, DIO1, DIO4, DIO5, DIO8, DIO9, DIO12, and DIO13 to output.
        7. Run the three instrument and open Logic Analyzer instrument. Save the profile as “profile2.ini”.
                - **Expected Result:** See that the profile is saved on the desired location and the logic analyzer should be set in a way that the rising and falling edge of the signal is clearly seen.
        8. Reload the default setting by deleting the file in ``C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Roaming\ADI``. Reload “profile2.ini”, and run Pattern Generator, DigitalIO and Logic Analyzer.
                - **Expected Result:** The result should be the same on the saved profile.
        9. Power Supply’s Settings: Set to “Tracking Mode” with 35% tracking setting. Set positive supply to 3V and the negative supply should automatically be set to -1.05V. Signal Generator’s Settings: For Channel 1: Sinewave, 2Vpp, 10kHz, For Channel 2: Sinewave, 1Vpp, 10kHz, 90deg phase. Voltmeter Settings: For Channel 1: DC (Direct Current), History – OFF, For Channel 2: AC (20Hz – 40kHz), History – ON (1s).

        11. Run Power Supply, Voltmeter and Signal Generator to see if the voltmeter will be able to read 3V on channel 1 and 0.7V on channel 2. Save the profile as “profile3.ini”.
                - **Expected Result:** Channel 1’s history should be off and channel 2’s history should be present and the reading must be stable.
        12. Reload the default setting by deleting the file in ``C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Roaming\ADI``. Reload “profile3.ini”, and run Power Supply, Voltmeter and Signal Generator.
                - **Expected Result:** The result should be the same on the saved profile. The network analyzer’s setting should be retained.

**Result:** PASS/FAIL

Test 4: Preferences
-----------------------------------------------
