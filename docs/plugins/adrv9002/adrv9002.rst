ADRV9002 (Jupiter) Plugin
================================================================================

Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The ADRV9002 (Jupiter) plugin provides a comprehensive interface for controlling and 
configuring the ADRV9002 dual-channel RF transceiver. This plugin enables users to 
manage both receive and transmit signal paths, configure device settings, and control 
FPGA-based signal generation features. The ADRV9002 is a dual-channel RF transceiver 
designed for software-defined radio applications with wide bandwidth and high performance.

The plugin is organized into four main sections providing complete control over the device 
functionality:

* **Device Global Settings** - System-wide configuration and status monitoring
* **Receive Chain** - RX channel configuration and signal path control
* **Transmit Chain** - TX channel configuration and signal path control
* **Profile Generator** - Integrated tools for creating and managing device profiles

Compatible Devices
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The ADRV9002 plugin is compatible with:

* ADRV9002 dual-channel RF transceiver platforms
* Systems implementing the ADRV9002 IIO driver interface
* Hardware platforms with ADRV9002 integrated designs

.. note::
   This plugin requires a compatible IIO context with ADRV9002 device support. Ensure that 
   the appropriate device drivers are installed and the hardware is properly connected.

Device Global Settings
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Device Global Settings section provides system-wide controls and monitoring capabilities:

**Profile Configuration**

  parameters including sampling rates, bandwidths, and signal path configurations.
  
  * **Load Profile**: Browse and select profile configuration files
  * **Profile Status**: Displays current profile information
  
  For detailed information about profiles, see the `ADRV9002 Driver Documentation <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-drivers/iio-transceiver/adrv9002#profiles>`_.

.. note::
   The plugin includes an integrated **Profile Generator** tab for creating profiles. This feature 
   requires the external libadrv9002-iio library to be installed.

**Temperature Monitoring**

* **v68.10.1 (v0.25)**: Supported in libadrv9002-iio v0.2.0 and later

.. note::
   If the Profile Generator tab appears grayed out or disabled, check that the libadrv9002-iio 
   library is properly installed and accessible in the system PATH.

.. note::
   Profile configurations are device-specific and must match the connected ADRV9002 hardware 
   capabilities. Invalid configurations will be rejected when loaded to the device.
