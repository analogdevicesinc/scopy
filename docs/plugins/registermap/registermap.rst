If the user has an .xml file of the register map that follows the format 
exmplained :ref:`here <xml_file_format>`  the plugin will generate an table 
view matching the .xml file contents 



User Guide 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1. User can use the address picker to select the address of the register 
      they want to read/write 

   2. Read button will read selected register

   3. The value of a register is shown here once read 

   4. To write a value to the register user can ether 

      * change the value from 3. then press Write button
      * change the value of the bitfields from 7. then press Write button 

   5. Toggle the detailed bitfields (7.) visible

   6. Register map table created based on .xml file. Each row represetns a 
      register the first colum is de register information and the following columns 
      represent the bitfields of the register

   7. For the selected register we display detailed informations about the 
      bitfields and allow user to change values at bitfield value 

   8. Use this menu to select the device you want to use

   9. Search bar can be used to filter the registers. The function will search

   * Address: the address of the register; 
   * Description: the description of the register; 
   * Exists: a true or false value; 
   * Width: the size of the register in bits; 
   * Notes: other observations; 
   * Bitfields: a list of Bitfield type elements; 

The structure of a bitfield is: 

   * Name: the name of the bitfield; 
   * Access: the type of access (read and/or write); 
   * DefaultValue: the default value of the bitfield; 
   * Width: the size of the bitfield in bits; 
   * RegOffset: the relative position of the bitfield to the register; 
   * BitOffset; 
   * SliceWidth; 
   * Visibility; 
   * Notes; 
   * Options: the list of possible values for the bitfield 

The structure of an Option type object: 
   * Desctiption: description for the option (will be used in the application) 
   * Value: the value in hexadecimal
