AD9084
========================================

Overview
---------

The **AD9084** instrument for Scopy enables integration and control of the
Apollo MxFE platform within the Scopy software environment. This plugin
allows users to configure and interact with the AD9084 ADC/DAC.

Instrument Layout

    :align: center

Device name indicator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the device that will be used to control the AD9084/AD9088 device.
The device name is also used to identify the device in the IIO device tree.
Default value is **axi-ad9084-rx-hpc**.

RX/TX enable buttons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These buttons allow enabling or disabling the RX and TX chain view in the Scopy instrument.
The actual RX/TX chain operation is not disabled/enabled, as the buttons only control the 
visibility of the RX and TX chain settings within the instrument interface.

Refresh button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This button will refresh the current configuration values of the AD9084/AD9088 device.
It will update all the displayed values in the instrument, ensuring that the user sees 
the latest configuration.

Settings menu button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This button will open the settings menu, allowing users to configure various parameters
of the AD9084/AD9088 device. The settings menu includes options for:

- **PFIR config**

  Allows users to load a PFIR filter configuration file. Make sure the 
  file has the correct format and compatible with the device. 
  The plugin provides a default PFIR configuration file that can be used as a starting point.
  A file dialog will open in the default FIR filter files location.

- **CFIR config**

  Allows users to load a CFIR filter configuration file. Make sure the 
  file has the correct format and compatible with the device. 
  The plugin provides a default CFIR configuration file that can be used as a starting point.
  A file dialog will open in the default FIR filter files location.

RX Chain settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The RX Chain section is a scrollable area containing configuration options for all the 
RX channels of the device. 

All the UI controls are interactive, displaying the state of the 
current operation, specifically a progress bar while the operation is in progress, becoming 
green or red based on the success or failure of the operation, respectively.
At startup all UI elements are initialized with the current values from the device.

Each RX channel section includes the following information:

- **Channel indicator**: Displays the channel number (e.g., Channel 1, Channel 2, etc.).
- **Channel label**: Indicates the FDDC/CDDC arrangement for the channel.
- **Channel enable**: A checkbox to enable or disable the channel. When successfully disabled, 
  the channel name size will be reduced to indicate that the channel is inactive.
- **CFIR enable**: A checkbox to enable or disable the CFIR filter for the channel.
- **CFIR profile**: A dropdown menu to select the CFIR profile for the channel.
- **ADC Frequency**: Control the ADC frequency. 
  The value is displayed in MHz and it is a shared value for all RX channels. Whenever 
  the value is changed for one channel, a read operation is performed to update all the 
  RX channels with the new value.
- **NCO Frequency**
- **NCO Phase**
- **Main NCO Frequency**
- **Main NCO Phase**
- **Test Mode**
- **Nyquist Zone**: A dropdown menu to select the Nyquist zone for the channel.
- **Loopback Mode**


TX Chain settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The TX Chain section is a scrollable area containing configuration options for all the 
TX channels of the device.

All the UI controls are interactive, displaying the state of the 
current operation, specifically a progress bar while the operation is in progress, becoming 
green or red based on the success or failure of the operation, respectively.
At startup all UI elements are initialized with the current values from the device.

Each TX channel section includes the following information:

- **Channel indicator**: Displays the channel number (e.g., Channel 1, Channel 2, etc.).
- **Channel label**: Indicates the FDUC/CDUC arrangement for the channel.

  the channel name size will be reduced to indicate that the channel is inactive.
- **CFIR enable**: A checkbox to enable or disable the CFIR filter for the channel.
- **CFIR profile**: A dropdown menu to select the CFIR profile for the channel.
- **DAC Frequency**: Control the DAC frequency. 
  The value is displayed in MHz and it is a shared value for all TX channels. Whenever 
  the value is changed for one channel, a read operation is performed to update all the 
  TX channels with the new value.
- **NCO Frequency**
- **NCO Phase**
- **Gain Scale**
- **Test Tone Scale**
- **Test Tone Enable**
- **Main NCO Frequency**
- **Main NCO Phase**
- **Main Test Tone Scale**
- **Main Test Tone Enable**
