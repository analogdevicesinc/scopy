.. _rms:

RMS  
================================================================================

The main purpose of this instrument is to display and graphically represent the 
RMS and the angle of each phase (for both voltage and current). At the same 
time, information such as voltage and current unbalance or flicker data can 
also be inferred from here. Each time new data is available, the tool updates 
accordingly.

The instrument is divided into two sections: 

#. Voltage: Shows the details of the voltage (left side).

#. Current: Shows the details of the current (right side).
