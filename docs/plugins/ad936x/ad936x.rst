AD936X
================================================================================

Description
---------------------------------

The AD936X plugin works with Scopy. You should always use the latest version
if possible. Changing any field will immediately write changes to the AD936X
settings to the hardware, and then read it back to make sure the setting is
valid. If you want to set something that the GUI changes to a different
number, that means the hardware (either the AD9361 or the FPGA fabric) does
not support that mode/precision.

If you want to manipulate the devices behind the back of the GUI (e.g., via
``/sys/bus/iio/devices/...``), you can still see the settings by clicking the
"refresh" button at the bottom.

If you think the device has a setting that isn't managed by this tab, check
out the AD936X Advanced Plugin for Scopy.

The AD936X view is divided in three sections:
  - **Device Global Settings**
  - **Receive Chain**
  - **Transmit Chain**
