AD936X Advanced
================================================================================

The AD936X Advanced plugin works with Scopy. Changing any field will
immediately write changes to the AD936X settings to the hardware, and then
read it back to make sure the setting is valid. If you want to set something
that the GUI changes to a different number, that means the hardware (either
the AD9361 or the FPGA fabric) does not support that mode/precision.

If you want to manipulate the devices behind the back of the GUI (e.g., via
``/sys/bus/iio/devices/...``), you can still see the settings by clicking the
"refresh" button.

The AD936X Advanced Plugin allows testing of different device driver
initialization options and values. In contrast to the controls on the AD936X
Main Plugin, the controls here are not part of the main driver API.

- In the No-OS driver, the values correspond to members of the setup/init
  structure.
- For the AD9361 Linux Device Driver, each control corresponds to a specific
  devicetree property.

See more details about `AD9361 Customization <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/
tools-software/linux-drivers/iio-transceiver/ad9361-customization>`_.

.. tip::
   **TIP:**
   After you customize the driver for your application needs, you can read
   back all values from the Linux debugfs:

   .. code-block:: bash

      root@linaro-ubuntu-desktop:~# cd /sys/kernel/debug/iio/iio\:device1/
      root@linaro-ubuntu-desktop:/sys/kernel/debug/iio/iio:device1# grep "" * |
      sed "s/:/ = </g" | awk '{print $0">;"}'
      adi,2rx-2tx-mode-enable = <1>;
      adi,agc-adc-large-overload-exceed-counter = <10>;
      [ -- snip -- ]

   Simply update the values here:
   `AD9361 Devicetree Initialization <https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-
   software/linux-drivers/iio-transceiver/ad9361#example_linux_device-tree_
   initialization>`_

   For the No-OS driver, the mapping can be found here:

  - Configure the Output Clock (``CLK_OUT`` pin) to output either a buffered 
  version of the external input clock (DCXO) or a divided version of the
  internal ADC sample clock (ADC_CLK) with selectable division ratios
  (÷2, ÷3, ÷4, ÷8, ÷16, ÷32, ÷64).

These controls provide flexible and detailed management of the device's
operating modes, clocking, and signal routing, allowing you to optimize the
AD936X for a wide range of applications and system requirements.

  tracking. This toggle allows you to optimize QEC performance for your
  application.

The graphical interface provides input fields and toggles for each parameter,
making it easy to adjust and experiment with these advanced settings.

BIST
-----

**AN IMAGE WILL BE HERE**

BIST stands for Built-In Self-Test. Selections on this tab take immediate
effect and therefore don’t require the Save Settings button. Functionality
exposed here is only meant to inject test patterns/data that can be used to
validate the Digital Interface or functionality of the device.

There are three major facilities. The topmost drop-down selection box allows
you to specify the injection point.

BIST Tone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User selectable tone (with frequency and level selection), that can be injected
into the RX or TX path. There are some checkboxes below that allow you to MASK
off certain channels. A masked channel (box checked) is not driving any data.
(This feature can be useful to determine the I,Q Rx1, Rx2 channel to data
mapping.)

BIST PRBS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pseudorandom Binary Sequence (PRBS) that can be injected into the RX or TX
path.

BIST Loopback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows either to digitally loopback TX data into the RX path or vice versa.

- **Digital TX -> Digital RX loopback:** The loopback happens inside the
  AD9361/4 close to the internal digital interface block. The entire RF
  section is bypassed. This can be used to validate (monitor on RX) the
  digital samples/symbols sent to the device.
- **RF RX -> RF TX loopback:** The loopback happens in the ADI provided HDL
  core. The Transmitter will transmit anything that the receiver receives. The
  entire RF chain is active (Sample rates, RF bandwidth and FIR settings will
  all affect the transmission.)
