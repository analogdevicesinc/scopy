AD74413R
============================================================================

Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The AD74413R tool is only available in the runtime mode, along with the
MAX14906 tool and the Faults tool. It represents the main interface for
the AD74413R chip and it dynamically shows all the channels configured
for that device. For each channel we can read/write data through this
interface using the libiio library.

The possible functions of an AD74413R channel are as follows: high_z,
voltage_out, current_out, voltage_in, current_in_ext, current_in_loop,
resistance, digital_input, digital_input_loop, current_in_ext_hart and
current_in_loop_hart. For each selected function, one or two channels
will be generated within the device context, which will be used for
communication with the physical channel.

Only the buffered input channel data can be displayed on the plot, and
in the case where a function generates both an input and an output
channel, the advanced menu will be associated with the output channel or
both channels. The channels generated according to the selected function
are as follow:

   :align: center

1. Run button

- The run button will start an acquisition task that will collect data
  from the active input channels.
- The acquisition task will stop upon user intervention.
- The data acquisition frequency is set by the user through the settings menu.
- All the data will be displayed on the plot.

2. Single Button

 The single button will start a single capture acquisition for all the active 
 input channels. The acquisition task will stop once all the data is acquired 
 and displayed on the plot.

3. Settings Button

 Show/Collapse the menu of general settings.

4. Advanced Menu Button

 Show/Collapse the advanced menu of the channels. Each channel is associated 
 with an advanced menu through which various attributes can be modified.

5. Menu Area

 Here is displayed the menu of general settings, as well as the advanced 
 menu for each channel.

6. Channels list

 The functions assigned to each channel are displayed here. The functions 
 with indices from 1 to 4 are correlated with the physical channels 
 on the board. 
 5 to 8 indices are correlated with the diagnostic channels. 
 When a channel is selected, it is highlighted.

7. Plot

 Display data from all the active channels. Display the number 
 of units per vertical division. Display the instant value
 for all channels.

8. Info button

9. Print button

 Save the plot with the data and channels into a PDF file.

10. Config button

 When pressing the config button, Scopy will switch the SWIOT1L mode to config.
 The device will briefly disconnect and then reconnect. After that it will 
 automatically display the Config Instrument.

Channel item layout
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Enable button

 Enable/Disable a channel. If a channel is disabled, it will no longer
 be displayed on the plot and data will not be acquired for it.

2. Channel function name

3. Menu button

 Show/Collapse the advanced menu of the selected channel.

Plot Layout
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
1. Drawing area for the curves

 Each input channel has a corresponding curve on the plot.

2. Curves handle area

 Each curve is associated with a handle through which we can position the 
 curves at different values on the Y-axis.

3. Acquisition status

 Display the number of acquired samples and the rate at which these samples 
 are acquired. The samples per second (SPS) is calculated based in the 
 frequency and the number of enabled channels.

 If you hover the info button you will find all the necessary information. 


General settings layout
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Acquisition settings section

 Sampling frequency represents the frequency at which data is acquired. It is 
 a property shared by all the available channels.
 Available options: 10, 20, 1200, 4800. The plot timespan can be set 
 between 100ms and 10s.

2. Export section

 It provides the possibility to export data corresponding to the activated 
 input channels into a CSV file. You
 can choose the channels for which data will be exported.

3. Arrow button

 The menu can be detached and reattached by pressing the arrow button 
 in the top right corner.

Tutorial 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A tutorial will automatically start first time the tool is open. It can
be restarted from tool Preferences.
