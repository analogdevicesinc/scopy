AD936x 
========================================

Overview
--------

The **AD936x** plugins for Scopy enable integration and control of AD936x-based devices within the Scopy software environment. 
These plugins allow users to visualize, analyze, and interact with RF signals and data streams via Scopy’s intuitive interface.

Features
--------

- **Device Discovery:** Automatic detection of connected PlutoSDR or AD936x devices.
- **Signal Acquisition:** Real-time streaming of I/Q data from the device.
- **Device Configuration:** Set parameters such as center frequency, bandwidth, sample rate, and gain.

Supported Devices
-------------------

- **AD936x Family** (including AD9361, AD9364, and compatible SDR platforms)
- **ADALM-Pluto (PlutoSDR)** (based on Analog Devices AD9363)
- **AD-FMCOMMS2/3/4** (with AD9361/AD9364)
- **AD-FMCOMMS5** (with AD9361/AD9364)

Getting Started
---------------

**Prerequisites**

- A supported SDR device (PlutoSDR or AD936x-based platform)
- Properly installed device drivers (see `ADI Drivers <https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/drivers>`_)
- Scopy version 2.1.0 or later
