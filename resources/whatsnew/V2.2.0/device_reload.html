<h1>Device Plugin Management</h1>

<p>The device pages now feature a streamlined tabbed interface that makes it easier to manage and configure device plugins without the need to disconnect and reconnect devices.</p>

<h2>New Tabbed Interface</h2>
<p>Device pages now include two dedicated tabs positioned at the bottom:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Device Info:</b> Traditional device information display with Connect/Disconnect controls</li>
  <li><b>Available Plugins:</b> Complete overview of all compatible plugins for your device</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Connect your device as usual from the device page.</li>
  <li>Click on the <b>Available plugins</b> tab at the bottom of the device page.</li>
  <li>Check or uncheck plugins to enable or disable them as needed.</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Reload</b> button to apply your plugin configuration changes.</li>
  <li>The device will be recreated with your selected plugins active.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The device reload feature recreates the device connection with the new plugin configuration. Any active measurements or configurations within plugins will be reset during the reload process.</p>
