    <h1>PQM</h1>
    <p>The PQM (power quality module) plugin adds support for Scopy PQM and the following components  </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>RMS</h2>
            <p>The main purpose of this instrument is to display and graphically represent the RMS and the angle of each phase (for both voltage and current). At the same time, information such as voltage and current unbalance or flicker data can also be inferred from here. Each time new data is available, the tool updates accordingly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Harmonics</h2>
            <p>The main purpose of this instrument is to display and graphically represent the voltage and current harmonics or inter harmonics. Each time new data is available, the tool updates accordingly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Waveform</h2>
            <p>The main purpose of this instrument is to display the waveform of the voltage and current for each phase. In one second, 10 cycles should be displayed at a frequency of 50 Hz, or 12 cycles at a frequency of 60 Hz.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
