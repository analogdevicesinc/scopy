    <h1>DAC plugin</h1>
    <p>The DAC plugin is used to interface with IIO DACs that implement the IIO buffer mechanism or a DDS mechanism. The plugin consists of an instrument with two data generation modes.

        The plugin is compatible with contexts that have at least one IIO device that implements an output IIO buffer or at least one DDS (ALTVOLTAGE) output channel.</p>
