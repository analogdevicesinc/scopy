<h1>Scripting Tool</h1>

<p>The new scripting tool in Scopy lets you automate workflows and instrument control using built-in scripting capabilities. With the integrated script editor, you can write, edit, and run scripts directly in Scopy. Scripts have access to supported instruments, allowing you to perform measurements, automate data collection, and execute complex or repetitive tasks. This feature is experimental and must be enabled in the application settings.</p>
