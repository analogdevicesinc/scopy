<h1>Debugger Code Generator</h1>

<p>The Debugger now includes a code generator that automatically creates ready-to-use C code snippets for interacting with IIO devices, channels, and attributes. Simply add items to the watchlist in the IIO Explorer, and the generator will produce code to read or write the selected device attributes and channels. You can instantly copy or save the generated code, which adapts to your current selections and includes error handling and helpful comments for easier integration and debugging.</p>
