KDE Runtime Docker image based on Ubuntu 18.04

The provided Dockerfile will install the KDE Runtime over the Ubuntu 18.04 base image.
Also, the obtained Docker image will contain the clone of https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/scopy-flatpak the scopy-flatpak recipe repository which can be found at /home/docker/scopy-flatpak

In order to build the Flatpak package for Scopy inside this Docker image, it needs to be run using "--privileged" (otherwise there is a lack of access to necessary utilities).

We built Scopy Flatpak in this image, then saved the newly created image as alexandratr/scopy-flatpak-bionic:scopy on Dockerhub. However, a clean image (without the Scopy Flatpak build) can be found as alexandratr/scopy-flatpak-bionic:clean on Dockerhub.

Running make inside the scopy-flatpak folder will build the Scopy.flatpak artifact. An example of how to do this is illustrated in the "build_appveyor_flatpak.sh" and "inside_flatpak_docker.sh" scripts (which deploys a Scopy.flatpak for each Appveyor nightly build).
